# To prevent the vehicle from overturning or skidding, the maximum lateral acceleration is limited (all examples are on flat ground), taking the minimum value if both are considered
# To prevent overturning, the maximum centripetal acceleration is gB/2h, where g is the gravitational acceleration, B is the wheelbase, and h is the center of gravity height
# To prevent skidding, the maximum centripetal acceleration is μg, where μ is the friction coefficient and g is the gravitational acceleration
# The current parameter is given randomly to verify its effectiveness
